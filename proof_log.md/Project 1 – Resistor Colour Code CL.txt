Project 1 – Resistor Colour Code CLI (Python)

Date: 15 July 2025  
GitHub: https://github.com/nikhilvitc73/ece-infra-labs/tree/main/resistor-color-cli

What I made:
I made a small Python program that asks the four colours on a resistor and gives the resistance value and tolerance.  
If the colours are wrong, it asks again.  

Why I made it:
This is my first beginner project.  
I made this because I wanted to start coding and connect it with electronics.  
This is also part of my Semester 1 infra plan.  

Mistakes I made:
- First I wrote wrong formula with string and numbers
- I didn’t know how to check inputs properly
- Push to GitHub failed, I used force push to fix it
- I got confused about PyCharm folder setup in the beginning  

Status:
Completed and uploaded to GitHub. It is working.
